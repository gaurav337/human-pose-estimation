## Introduction
This project focuses on Human Pose Estimation, a cutting-edge application in computer vision that involves detecting and tracking human body keypoints using Machine Learning. The goal is to create an accurate and efficient model for predicting human poses in various contexts, such as fitness tracking, motion analysis, and human-computer interaction.

## Motivation
With the growing demand for intelligent systems that can interact seamlessly with humans, human pose estimation has become a key area of research. Its applications span across healthcare, sports, entertainment, and interactive technologies, showcasing its immense potential.

## Objectives
- Implement a Machine Learning model for human pose estimation.
- Achieve real-time performance with accurate keypoint detection.
- Test the model on diverse datasets to ensure robustness.
- Provide a user-friendly pipeline for detecting poses.

## Features
- Detection of major human body keypoints (e.g., head, shoulders, elbows, knees, etc.).
- Real-time pose estimation using pre-trained models.
- Integration with frameworks like PyTorch and OpenCV.
- Visualization of detected poses with annotated keypoints.

## Installation
Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/gaurav337/human-pose-estimation.git
cd human-pose-estimation
```
Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
(Optional) If using a dev container, follow the instructions in the `.devcontainer/` directory to set up your environment.

## Usage
Run the pose estimation script:
```bash
python src/main-code.py --input <path_to_image_or_video>
```
The results will be saved in the `output_images/` directory. Visualizations will include keypoints detected on the image or video.

## Results
- The model achieves accurate pose estimation across various datasets.
- Sample visualizations can be found in the `output_images/` folder.

## Future Work
- Enhance model accuracy with more advanced architectures, such as transformers.
- Extend support for multi-person pose estimation.
- Optimize the model for deployment on edge devices using quantization techniques.
